              <h4>I am Alex M Sanchez.</h4>
			<h4>Some people spend their lives searching. Searching for what gives them meaning, searching for something that makes them feel alive, searching for the answer.</h4>
			<h4>And I, I found mine.</h4>
			<h4>I found it in the time of day we call “golden,” found it in square plastic of a viewfinder, found it in the wrinkles of the old and homeless, the twinkle of light in a stranger’s eyes.</h4>
			<h4>I have worked as a photographer and written for <a ref="http://homemagazinegainesville.com/">Home Magazine</a> and <a href="http://gainesvilletoday.com"/>Gainesville Today</a> (both local lifestyle magazines), the <a href="http://www.alligator.org/">Florida Independent Alligator</a> (one of the nation’s largest student-run college newspapers), the <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/">Miami Herald</a> and I am currently working with the <a href="http://www.gainesville.com/">Gainesville Sun</a>.</h4>
			<h4>My work consists of photographic stills from the photojournalistic to the artistic. I have worked with video as well, creating online content for the Miami Herald and soon the Gainesville Sun as well. I have also travel blogged and created work that pertains to my travels.</h4> 
			<h4>One of my proudest moments (although not photographically linked) was in high school when I organized the building of a library in Nicaragua (the town where my mother grew up) and then traveled with six of my peers to the town and built it ourselves. We raised about $2,000, collected over 4,000 books and 10 computers.</h4> 
			<h4>I am currently working with a Nikon D3200, a 50mm 1.4, 18-55mm 3.4, 55-200mm 3.4 and a 35-70mm 2.8. I am in the process of selling my Nikon equipment and moving to Canon to improve my video work.</h4>
			<h4>My interests in my heart lie in humanitarian and travel photography. But my imagination is constantly dreaming up different created scenes. I am interested in all of it at once, and I allow myself to be torn between the found and the created on a daily basis. My ultimate dream would be to become a creative director for humanitarian efforts, and I hope to join the Peace Corps when I graduate in a year. </h4>
			<h4>My hopes for the future are simple: support myself through one of the true passions of my life. It seems silly to think that life sometimes complicates, specifies and compartmentalizes the future, but for me it’s simple: when I grow up I want to stop time and make moments live forever. </h4>
			<h4>So this is my ode to my love, my one and only, to photography…</h4>
			<h4>……</h4>
 			<h4>and to you. Hire us?</h4>
