			<h3>People of Gainesville Blog</h3><h4><a href="http://peopleof-gainesville.tumblr.com/">People of Gainesville</a> is a blog dedicated to exploring people I find interesting in and around Gainesville. This will be for my own personal entertainment and keep me working everyday. This idea was inspired by <a href="http://www.humansofnewyork.com/">Humans of New York </a> - a blog dedicated to showing interesting people found on the streets of NYC. I have found that college campuses have the most diverse groups of people and I look forward to exploring that. I know this is not my original idea but essentially this is what photojournalists do. They find interesting people and stories and let the world know about them.</h4>
